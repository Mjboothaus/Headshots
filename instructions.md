# Parameter Explanations

- **Preset**: Choose a pre-configured setting from available profiles or Custom to manually adjust all settings
- **Target Width/Height**: Final dimensions of the headshot in pixels
- **Top Padding Ratio**: Adds space above the face (fraction of face height) for headroom
- **Bottom Padding Ratio**: Adds space below the face for shoulders
- **Side Padding Ratio**: Adds space on the left and right of the face
- **Shift X/Y**: Moves the crop box left/right (X) or up/down (Y) in pixels. Positive X shifts right, positive Y shifts down
- **Zoom Out Factor**: Scales the crop box (1.0 = no zoom-out, 1.5 = 50% larger crop). Higher values include more of the image
- **Border Colour**: Colour of borders added to maintain the target aspect ratio
